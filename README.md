Animal Shelter Record Database

SAVEUS is a project to solve many deficiencies in the animal sheltering industry.
Our main goals are to:

1. increase adoption and reclamation rates

2. decrease euthanasia rates

3. increase transparency within animal welfare agencies (financially and otherwise)

4. facilitate communication between local and national organizations and surrounding communities

This will be accomplished with our system of services that will be composed of two parts, a record management system (RMS) for
organizations to use, and a website used to show statistics generated from the RMS, as well as post animals that have been found
or are up for adoption.


We are currently using C# with MySQL for the RMS, and PHP for the website.
